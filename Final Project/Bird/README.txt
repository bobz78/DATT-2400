for this final project I wanted to make a game like flappy bird and make it 
fully feel like your playing a game where you have a score and even a gameover
screen after you lose.
the game is simple you press space to stay up gravity will bring you down
and if you fall blow the screen or collide with any pipe you will die.
there is a setting for difficulty however it still is a work in progress but
you can uncomment the line 80:increaseDifficulty(); to test it out.
the bird is animated and there is a full enviornment to the game using PImage
I gave a bit of margin for error when it comes to the player collision for the
game to be more fun but if you want a more accurate collision you can change
the values in line 147.
